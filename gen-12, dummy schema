If ReceiptDetails will always be the same for all RevenueSection and RevenueEntry records, we can simplify the schema by merging ReceiptDetails into the RevenueForm model. This reduces complexity and avoids unnecessary relationships.

Here’s the updated Prisma schema:

Merged Prisma Schema
prisma
Copy
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model RevenueForm {
  id            Int              @id @default(autoincrement())
  grandTotal    Float            // Sum of all amounts in the form
  amountInWords String           // Grand total amount expressed in words
  receiptNumber String           // Receipt number issued by the collection office
  cashAmount    Float            // Amount received in cash
  chequeAmount  Float            // Amount received via cheque
  totalAmount   Float            // Total amount (cash + cheque)
  revenueSections RevenueSection[] // One-to-many relationship with RevenueSection
  createdAt     DateTime         @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime         @updatedAt
}

model RevenueSection {
  id          Int            @id @default(autoincrement())
  sectionType String         // "Cash Basis" or "Accrual Basis"
  entries     RevenueEntry[] // One-to-many relationship with RevenueEntry
  revenueForm RevenueForm    @relation(fields: [revenueFormId], references: [id])
  revenueFormId Int          // Foreign key to RevenueForm
  createdAt   DateTime       @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime       @updatedAt
}

model RevenueEntry {
  id             Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  department     String   // Name of the department
  revenueHead    String   // Name of the revenue head
  amount1        Float    // First amount column
  amount2        Float    // Second amount column
  depositedWith  String   // Where the amount is deposited
  revenueSection RevenueSection @relation(fields: [revenueSectionId], references: [id])
  revenueSectionId Int    // Foreign key to RevenueSection
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt
}

```
Explanation of the Merged Schema
RevenueForm:

Now includes all fields from ReceiptDetails:

receiptNumber: Receipt number issued by the collection office.

cashAmount: Amount received in cash.

chequeAmount: Amount received via cheque.

totalAmount: Total amount (cash + cheque).

Retains the grandTotal and amountInWords fields.

Has a one-to-many relationship with RevenueSection.

RevenueSection:

Represents a section for revenue accounting (either "Cash Basis" or "Accrual Basis").

Contains:

sectionType: Indicates whether it's "Cash Basis" or "Accrual Basis."

entries: A one-to-many relationship with RevenueEntry.

revenueForm: A many-to-one relationship with RevenueForm.

RevenueEntry:

Represents an individual entry in a revenue section.

Contains:

department: Name of the department.

revenueHead: Name of the revenue head.

amount1 and amount2: Two amount columns.

depositedWith: Where the amount is deposited.

revenueSection: A many-to-one relationship with RevenueSection.

Updated Controller for Creating RevenueForm
Here’s how the controller would look to create a RevenueForm with its associated RevenueSection and RevenueEntry records:

javascript
Copy
const prisma = require('./prisma'); // Import Prisma Client

// Create Revenue Form with Sections and Entries
```javascript
const createRevenueForm = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const {
      grandTotal,
      amountInWords,
      receiptNumber,
      cashAmount,
      chequeAmount,
      totalAmount,
      revenueSections, // Array of RevenueSection objects
    } = req.body;

    // Create RevenueForm along with its RevenueSection and RevenueEntry records
    const revenueForm = await prisma.revenueForm.create({
      data: {
        grandTotal,
        amountInWords,
        receiptNumber,
        cashAmount,
        chequeAmount,
        totalAmount,
        revenueSections: {
          create: revenueSections.map((section) => ({
            sectionType: section.sectionType,
            entries: {
              create: section.entries, // Create associated RevenueEntry records
            },
          })),
        },
      },
      include: {
        revenueSections: {
          include: {
            entries: true, // Include the created entries in the response
          },
        },
      },
    });

    // Send success response
    res.status(201).json({
      success: true,
      message: "Revenue Form created successfully",
      data: revenueForm,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating Revenue Form:", error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: "Failed to create Revenue Form",
      error: error.message,
    });
  }
};

module.exports = {
  createRevenueForm,
};
Example Request Body
Here’s an example of the req.body that the controller expects:

  "amountInWords": "Six Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty Rupees",
  "receiptNumber": "REC12345",

  "totalAmount": 6750,
  "revenueSections": [
    {
      "sectionType": "Cash Basis",
      "entries": [
        {
          "department": "Tax Department",
          "revenueHead": "Holding Transfer Charges",
          "amount1": 1000,
          "amount2": 500,
          "depositedWith": "Bank A"
        },
        {

          "amount2": 750,
          "depositedWith": "Bank C"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

            "amount2": 500,
            "depositedWith": "Bank A"
          },
          {
            "id": 2,

            "amount2": 1000,
            "depositedWith": "Bank B"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "sectionType": "Accrual Basis",
        "entries": [
          {
            "id": 3,
            "department": "Water Supply",
            "revenueHead": "Water Tax, Water Benefit Tax",
            "amount1": 1500,
            "amount2": 750,
            "depositedWith": "Bank C"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Benefits of Merged Schema
Simplified Structure:

No need for a separate ReceiptDetails model.

All receipt-related fields are now part of RevenueForm.

Easier Queries:

Fetching all data related to a RevenueForm is now a single query.

Reduced Complexity:

Fewer relationships to manage.
